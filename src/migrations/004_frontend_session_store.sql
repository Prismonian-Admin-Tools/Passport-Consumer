-- Backs Passport Consumer's own frontend cookie session (connect-pg-simple)
-- with Postgres instead of express-session's default in-memory store,
-- which the library itself warns is not fit for production: every session
-- lost on restart, and it can't be shared across more than one process.
-- Named distinctly from the existing `sessions` table, which is a
-- completely different thing — opaque tokens issued to CLIENT APPS via
-- /api/v1/login, not this frontend's own cookie session.
-- Schema matches connect-pg-simple's expected default exactly (see its
-- own table.sql) so it needs no createTableIfMissing permission at runtime.
